First try on some game dev, dino like game only with a cat.

## Requirements
- c++
- sfml library, more on: https://www.sfml-dev.org/

## Limitations
- Difficulty only makes the game go faster
- Pausing in small window will make the pause screen in full screen buggy
- After entering fullscreen game goes faster

## Next dev

- Add more obstacles and levels
